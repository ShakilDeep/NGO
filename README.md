The 'NGO_Work.ipynb' notebook is a comprehensive project that involves the development of a machine learning model for a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO). 

The primary objective of this model is to predict certain outcomes based on a variety of factors. 

These factors, which serve as the input for the model, include the loan amount, due amount, saving balance, and the number of days until the loan expires. 

The model is trained using a dataset that contains these factors, and then it is tested to evaluate its performance. 

The performance of the model is measured using several metrics, including the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 

These metrics provide a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy and efficiency. 

Once the model has been trained and tested, it is saved as a pickle file. 

This allows the model to be loaded and used in the future without the need for retraining, thus saving computational resources and time.
